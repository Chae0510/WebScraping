# WebScraping
### 1. Choose a website with publicly accessible data that includes a numerical target variable. Suggested websites: Indeed, Etsy.
### 2. Use a programming language of choice (consider Python with libraries like BeautifulSoup and Selenium) to write a simple web scraper to extract specific information related to the target variable from the chosen website. (At least 1000 rows)
### 3. Focus on fundamentals such as making HTTP requests, parsing HTML, and extracting relevant data.
### 4. Save it as .csv

#### Output: items.csv
