#### 1-1. Choose a website with publicly accessible data that includes a numerical target variable. Suggested websites: Indeed, Etsy.
#### 1-2. Use a programming language of choice (consider Python with libraries like BeautifulSoup and Selenium) to write a simple web scraper to extract specific information related to the target variable from the chosen website. (At least 1000 rows)

### Condition
#### 2-1. Obtain a small dataset by collecting data using the web scraper from Part 1. The dataset should include the numerical target variable.
#### 2-2. Use a tool like Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
#### 2-3. Apply basic statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation) to understand the distribution of the target variable.

#### After Preprocessing
